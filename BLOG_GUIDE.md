Copy this template and add it to the `blogPosts` array:

```typescript
{
  title: "Your Blog Post Title",
  excerpt: "A brief 1-2 sentence description that appears on the blog page...",
  content: `
    # Your Blog Post Title
    
    Write your blog content here using simple formatting:
    
    ## Subheadings
    Use ## for subheadings
    
    ### Smaller Subheadings
    Use ### for smaller subheadings
    
    **Bold text** - wrap text in **double asterisks**

    - Bullet point 1
    - Bullet point 2

    console.log("Hello World");
    \`\`\`
    
    Links: [Link text](https://example.com)
  `,
  tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"], // Add relevant tags
  date: "2025-01-15", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD
  readTime: "5 min read", // Estimate reading time
  slug: "your-blog-post-title", // URL-friendly version (lowercase, hyphens)
  author: "Mohammed Faraz Saudagar"
}
```

### Step 3: Fill in Your Content

### Quick Tech Tip Post
```typescript

  title: "Quick Git Tip: Squashing Commits",
  excerpt: "Learn how to clean up your Git history by squashing multiple commits into one.",
  content: `
    # Quick Git Tip: Squashing Commits
    
    Sometimes you want to combine multiple commits into a single, clean commit. Here's how:
    
    ## Interactive Rebase
    \`\`\`
    git rebase -i HEAD~3
    \`\`\`
    
    This opens an editor where you can:
    - Pick the first commit
    - Squash the others with 's'
    
    ## Why Squash?
    - Cleaner commit history
    - Easier to review
    - Better for team collaboration

    # Building Bookworms: Lessons from iOS Development
    
    Recently, I built Bookworms, an iOS app for tracking and reviewing books. Here are the key lessons learned.
    
    ## Technical Stack
    - **Swift** for the main language
    - **UIKit** for the interface
    - **Core Data** for local storage
    
    ## Challenges
    ### Data Modeling
    Designing the Core Data model for books, reviews, and user interactions required careful planning.
    
    ### UI/UX Design
    Creating an intuitive interface for book discovery and review writing.
    
    ## What I Learned
    1. Core Data relationships are powerful but complex
    2. User testing early saves time later
    3. iOS Human Interface Guidelines are worth following
    
    ## Next Steps
    Planning to add social features and book recommendations.
